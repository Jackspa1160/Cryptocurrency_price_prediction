# **Cryptocurrency Prediction with Artificial Intelligence V3.0 [GRU Neural Network]**
I am pleased to announce with you the V3.0 of my cryptocurrency prediction project with Artificial Intelligence. I used LSTM in V1.0 and RNN in V2.0. In V3.0, I use the GRU Neural Network, whose algorithms that I have designed myself. The artificial intelligence I created managed to achieve 99.54% accuracy in the March 27 BTC Forecast. Scores are; Total params: 104.658.433, MAE score: 0.02262356696266076, MSE score: 0.0008216340443992631, Accuracy: 98.5220357283052. Another element that I developed in the project is that I wrote algorithm code to visualize neural networks so that people can understand the GRU structure. Everything happens automatically. I am happy to share the project as open source.
